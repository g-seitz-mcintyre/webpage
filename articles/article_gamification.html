        <h1>Gamification</h1>
        <p>At Cheil Germany a big chunk of the work we do revolves around helping brands deliver amazing user experiences to their end consumers. The Black Friday campaign for Samsung is a good example. It&apos;s one of our favorite projects of the year because we get to be very creative and implement innovative concepts on a European level. In recent years Gamification has become one of the core elements to increase user engagement during this extremely important international shopping holiday. </p>
        
        <p>Gamification is a fascinating topic. To learn more about it, I recently started reading Yu-kai Chou&apos;s book „Actionable Gamification: Beyond Points, Badges, and Leaderboards“, which contains many helpful concepts to consider when designing great user experiences.</p>
        
        <p>The book&apos;s main message is that any good user experience needs to speak to eight Core Drives. If an experience is designed with these Core Drives in mind, even previously dull interactions could be turned into engaging activities. I believe that Gamification or „Human-Centered Design“ as Yu-kai Chou prefers to call it, can be applied in almost any context.</p>

        <p>Everybody knows how hard it is to break bad habits. Me, for example, I&apos;ve tried to quit smoking multiple times. When I finally succeeded, it was simply because I turned the „quit smoking“ objective into a gamifed experience. Drawing on Core Drive 2 (Development and Accomplishment) I created a kind of progress bar that constantly reminded me how many days it&apos;s been since my last cigarette. Thanks to this visual cue and the desire to prolong the „streak“ it became easier and even somewhat fun.</p>

        <p>Another one of my favorite examples for effective gamification is the app Freeletics. The app uses various game elements including points, badges and leaderboards to keep users engaged. Not only do I feel good about myself when I achieve another „perfect week“ but I also feel frustration when my overall Freeletics score drops because I did not do my workouts consistently. In this case Freeletics effectively employs Core Drive 2 (Development & Achievement) and Core Drive 7 (Scarcity and Avoidance) to help me achieve my fitness goals.</p>

        <p>Gamification can come in many (sometimes very subtle) forms. Yu-kai Chou distinguishes between explicit and implicit gamification. Explicit gamification describes situations where users are actually playing a game, whereas implicit gamification is the use of game elements and techniques where users are performing tasks that cannot be counted as „playing“ per se.</p>

        <p>A good example for implicit gamification, in my opinion, is the the progress bar you often see when reading online articles these days. Before, you would often not know how long it will take to read an article. You&apos;d then scroll down to see how long the article is. At least for me this is often the point where I navigate back to the Google search results because I don&apos;t have the attention span for such a long article. A progress bar at the top of the page seems to mitigate this effect by providing me with immediate feedback on how far I&apos;ve already read, encouraging me to read on.</p>
